# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Ansible role to install SumoCollector. This role was based on wgregorian as recommended by Sumo staff.  That was a native install using yum.  
  We now support yum, tarball and docker installs.  Hot patches would likely be first available via tarball for testing bugfixes with sumologic team.

  Changelog from wgregorian
  -------------------------
  Switched from single source file to /etc/sumo/sumo.d
  Supports automatic docker app logs if using journald or syslog driver.
  By default installs sumo as systemd unit running a docker container.
  Supports file based (rather than cloud based) management.
  Tunes host to avoid sumo errors setting ulimits.
  Installs sysstat to host for performance monitoring to support Linux Performance Dashboard.
  Sets up cron jobs for sysstat and disk checks.
  Installs monitors for traefik and mesos.
  Installs host metrics to support Host Metrics dashboard
  Transitions from old sumo.conf to recommended user.properties file.

  Having extra files in /etc/sumo/sumo.d is not a problem.  If path is not found
  sumo blade will not load.  Sumo watches the sourcefile or folder so changes
  should be taken up automatically without restarting the process.

  Currently only the docker install method is fully supported.  
  The yum install seems to lag behind docker and tarball versions
  and sumo support recommended the tar or docker install.
  The docker container closely resembles the tar install (/opt/SumoCollector).
  If a native install is needed, handlers.yml would need to be modified and
  a systemd service based on native install should be written for surviving host shutdowns etc.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  # ansible-sumocollector
  ###### Ansible role to install SumoCollector. This role was inspired by modcloth's SumoCollector role, but it goes one step further by including the ability to include additional log paths.

  ## Role Variables

  ### RedHat OS Family
  ```
  For a complete list see defaults.yml

  deployment_id: Following sumo best practices, there is a top-level deployment_id which sets
  _sourceCategory allowing indexing based on deployment.

  # Credentials.  Set these in your environment or over-ride.
  sumologic_collector_accessid: "{{ lookup('env', 'SUMO_COLLECTOR_ACCESS_ID' }}"
  sumologic_collector_accesskey: "{{ lookup('env', 'SUMO_COLLECTOR_ACCESS_KEY' }}"
  sumocollector_installer_rpm: "https://collectors.sumologic.com/rest/download/rpm/64"
  sumologic_installer_rpm_local_folder: "/tmp"
  ```

  ### Debian OS Family
  ```
  sumologic_installer_remote_file: "/tmp/sumocollector.deb"
  sumocollector_installer_download: "https://collectors.sumologic.com/rest/download/deb/64"
  ```

  ### Credentials
  ```
  - assuming environment variables $sumologic_collector_accessid and $sumologic_collector_accesskey are set:
  sumologic_collector_accessid: "{{ lookup('env','sumologic_collector_accessid') }}"
  sumologic_collector_accesskey: "{{ lookup('env','sumologic_collector_accesskey') }}"
  ```

  ### Allow overwrite of old collectors. 
  - See: https://service.sumologic.com/help/Default.htm#Using_Clobber.htm
  ```
  sumologic_collector_clobber: ""
  sumologic_installer_file: ""
  sumologic_collector_source_template: "collector.json.j2"
  sumologic_collector_timezone: "UTC"
  sumologic_collector_force_timezone: "false"
  ```

  ### log names and location
  - be sure to specify the sumologic_collector_default_log_path variable, as below pattern for 1 or many log locations:
  ```
  sumologic_collector_default_log_path:
    - name: "EXAMPLE LOG"
      path: "/var/log/EXAMPLE.log"
      use_multiline: false
      category: "EXAMPLE"
    - name: "EXAMPLE LOG 2"
      path: "/var/log/EXAMPLEi2.log"
      use_multiline: false
      category: "EXAMPLE2"
  ```

  ### Group variable example:
  - be sure to specify the sumologic_collector_application_log_path variable, as below pattern for 1 or many log locations:
  ```
  sumologic_collector_application_log_path:
    - name: "APP LOG"
      path: "/var/log/APP.log"
      use_multiline: false
      category: "APP" 
  ```

examples: |-
  ### Installation

  #### via ansible-galaxy
  ##### installation-A
  - run `ansible-galaxy install wgregorian.sumocollector`

  ###### or
  ##### installation-B
  - requirements.yml

  ```
  ---
      - src: wgregorian.sumocollector
  ```
  - and run the following to make the role available to playbook:
  `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`

  and running:
  `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`

  Example Commandline Options
  ---------------------------
  `ansible-playbook -i /path/to/hosts site.yml -e sumologic_force_restart=yes -e @/ath/to/over-ride-vars.yml`

  ## Legacy vars for sumo.conf.j2
  These could be migrated to user.properties.

  ```
  sumologic_installer_file: ""
  sumologic_collector_source_template: "collector.json.j2"
  sumologic_collector_timezone: "UTC"
  sumologic_collector_force_timezone: "false"
  sumologic_collector_default_log_path:
    - name: "EXAMPLE LOG"
      path: "/var/log/EXAMPLE.log"
      use_multiline: false
      category: "EXAMPLE"
  ```

  Group variable example:

  ```
  sumologic_collector_application_log_path:
    - name: "APP LOG"
      path: "/var/log/APP.log"
      use_multiline: false
      category: "APP" }
  ```

  ##### playbook
  - sample
  ```
  ---
      - hosts: servers
        roles:
          - role: wgregorian.sumocollector
  ```
  #### via librarian-ansible
  - Ansiblefile
  ```
  role 'ansible-sumocollector',
    git: 'https://github.com/wgregorian/ansible-sumocollector.git'
  ```
  ##### playbook
  - sample
  ```
  ---
  - hosts: all
    roles:
    - role: ansible-sumocollector
